        <p>What do women think of men who can cook？</p>
        <p>自己的男人会做饭是种什么体验？</p>
    </div>

    <div class="body hidden">

        <p>This is a very very sweet question. I think I might give a good answer to it as I have been blessed to have
            known
            such men.</p>
        <p>这个问题很有意思，我想我可以很好的回答这个问题，因为我有幸认识这些人。</p>
        <p>My younger brother and two of my extremely close friends are excellent at cooking and so I will answer the
            question keeping them in mind.</p>
        <p>我的弟弟和我的两个好朋友都很擅长做饭，所以我将以他们为原型来回答。</p>
        <p>Before I answer this, I would like to mention that I might be a little biased because I love to eat. I am a
            big
            big foodie （veg） and my taste buds never seem to get contented and are in constant search of a new delicacy
            24X7. I myself know nothing about cooking. I can not even make proper Maggi. Okay that being said, let me
            start
            answering the question as to what do I think of men who can cook.</p>
        <p>
            在我回答之前呢，我想提一下我自己算得上是一个极度偏执的人，因为我很爱吃。我就是个吃货（素食），我的味蕾从未被满足过，并且7×24小时不间断的寻找美食。然而，我自己对下厨一无所知，甚至麦琪面都下不好。好了，接下来让我来开始回答，在我看来男人会做饭是怎样的。</p>
        <p>1. They are interested in the smallest details.</p>
        <p><strong>他们对很小的细节感兴趣</strong></p>
        <p>What do normal people do when they go to a restaurant？ Ok. I will tell you what I do. I either order the
            dishes
            based on my interest in a particular constituent （like Paneer） or else if I am in a mood to order something
            new
            I decide the dish based on its picture that is printed inside the menu. Yes, this is my level of ordering.
            Now
            when I go out with my brother or my friends who love to cook this is what they will do- Read the names of
            the
            dishes aloud. Also read what all it contains （whatever is written below their names in the braces）. Try to
            imagine how it would taste if they made it. If they are still unsatisfied they'll probably call someone from
            the
            staff and ask the varying details as to what is the procedure and what exactly is used to prepare that dish.
            And
            they do all this with so much interest. All this while, I just look here and there impatiently, thinking why
            can't he just order whatever he wants to！</p>
        <p>
            大部分人去餐厅时会怎样做？好吧，我来告诉你我一般怎么做。要么根据我自己喜好点几种特定成分的菜（例如奶酪），要么心情好的时候，根据菜单上的图片来点一些新菜式。是的，这就是我点菜的水平。现在当我和我弟或者喜欢做饭的朋友一起出去时，他们会这样做：大声念出菜名，同时也会念出它包含些什么（无论菜名后面的括号里写的是什么）。他们会尝试想象一下如果自己做出来会是什么味道。如果他们还不满足于念出菜名，有可能还会叫来服务员，询问各种细节，比如制作的过程，那道菜通常要提前准备什么。他们对这个太感兴趣了！与此同时，我只好不耐烦的看这看那，心想，为什么他就不能随便点任何想吃的东西呢？</p>
        <p>2. They are never satisfied with their perfection.</p>
        <p><strong>他们极度追求完美</strong></p>
        <p>They might have just cooked a finger licking delicacy which you eat like hungry soul when served to you and
            you
            are like, "Wow！ Can this get any better？ This is palatable. Marvellous." But when they taste it, they make
            strange faces, whose meaning is still unknown to me, and comment on what minute faults they had made and
            take
            mind notes for avoiding those （unknown） mistakes in the future.</p>
        <p>
            当他们为你刚做好一道鲜汁四溢佳肴，你如狼似虎的吃着，“天呐，不能更好吃了，太美味了，简直了！”。但当他们尝了一下，脸上摆出的奇怪的表情，我至今都没理解什么意思，他们会然后点评了一下小的不足并记在脑子里避免将来还犯同样的错误。</p>
        <p>3. They are sexy.</p>
        <p><strong>他们很性感</strong></p>
        <p>We love to watch a man cooking. It's really hard to not fall in love with a man cooking int he kitchen.
            Watching
            a man using his hands to delicately create something, a petite dish, is such a turn on. It goes way beyond
            gifting some pretty things. There is something really sensual about them cooking. Watching them as they are
            preparing a breakfast for you or making a cup of coffee definitely increases their sexy quotient by large
            numbers.</p>
        <p>
            我们很爱看一个男人在做饭，真的很难不爱上一个厨房里的男人。看着他用双手创造出精美的一道菜，如此动人。它超过了其它赏赐，他们做饭的姿态透着某种性感。看着他们为你准备一顿早餐或者一杯咖啡，绝对可以大幅度拉高性感指数。</p>
        <p>4. They often add new experiences to your life.</p>
        <p><strong>他们经常给你的生活带来新体验</strong></p>
        <p>They are always excited and interested to invent new dishes and also learn different cuisines that you might
            never have tasted before. They bring a newness in your life and this is such a desirable trait.</p>
        <p>他们总乐意去发明新的菜式，也会学习各种你可能从没听过的烹饪方法。他们给你的生活带来新花样，这是可遇不可求的品质。</p>
        <p>5. They are against this nonsensical belief that cooking is a woman's job.</p>
        <p><strong>他们觉得“做饭是女人的工作”这种想法很荒谬</strong></p>
        <p>These men understand that there is no such constraint with cooking and this is something that is not just
            restricted or curtailed or meant for women alone. They break out of this utterly irritating fact （esp here
            in
            India） and are not only happy but also delighted in carrying out this sweet act of cooking. This quality is
            so
            admirable.</p>
        <p>这些人理解的下厨，是没有那么多局限的，这件事不仅仅限制只有女性才能做，他们完全打破这个令人愤怒的事实（印度除外），他们乐意并且为做出爱心饭菜的行为感到高兴。</p>
        <p>6. They are always ready to feed you.</p>
        <p><strong>他们可以时刻为你做吃的</strong></p>
        <p>No matter if it is midday or midnight; if you ever pose a desire in front of them and ask them to make
            something
            for you to eat, be rest assured that they would never ever deny. Even at home, when during night my stomach
            growls due to hunger, I request my otherwise belligerent brother to make something and he never says a no.
            Instead he brings something totally unexpected that you wonder how he made such a great thing to eat out of
            the
            same old ingredients. Thanks bro. :P</p>
        <p>
            无论是中午还是半夜，只要你在他们面前表达意愿，想要他做东西给你吃，放心吧，他绝对不会拒绝你。甚至半夜在家里，我的胃由于饿在咕咕叫的时候，我请求正在忙其它事情的弟弟做点吃的，他从未说一个不字。相反，他总能带来你怎么也想不通他是如何利用以前一样的食材，做出完全超乎意料的东西来。谢谢老弟：P</p>
        <p>7. They are healthier than the rest of us.</p>
        <p><strong>他们身体比我们健康</strong></p>
        <p>Having so much knowledge about the various kinds of food, they are aware of which kind of food is healthy and
            which is probably not very good for your body and might actually be harmful. So they keep themselves and
            others
            around them safe and healthy by recommending a balanced and a healthy diet. They avoid consuming and letting
            others consume unhealthy food.</p>
        <p>拥有大量关于各式食物的知识，他们知道哪种食物是健康的，哪种可能对身体不好甚至是有害的。所以他们通过推荐相对均衡、健康的饮食习惯，让自己和身边的人也安全健康起来。</p>
        <p>8. They are good conversation starters, especially at new places.</p>
        <p><strong>他们很擅长打开一个话题，特别是在陌生场合</strong></p>
        <p>Food is something which is likable throughout the planet. When you are at a new place as a tourist or as any
            other person, these men can easily start conversations with the localites. It is a pleasure to travel with
            them
            because they always know how to break the ice and assume a friendly relation with any stranger.</p>
        <p>全世界到处遍布食物，当你以一名游客或者其它身份出现在一个陌生地点时，这些会做饭的人会很轻易的跟当地人搭上话，和他们一起旅游会感到很轻松，因为他们总知道怎样不会冷场，不感到尴尬，跟陌生人可以很友好的交流。</p>
        <p>9. They are the favorites of every mother.</p>
        <p><strong>他们是天底下所有妈妈的“菜”</strong></p>
        <p>Just introduce them to your mom and tell her that he cooks and she is not going to listen to anything else.
            She
            will be damn impressed by him and might even start talking about some dishes and such things. They are the
            favorites of every mother （at least here in India）. Your mom would shout at you and say, "Learn something
            from
            him. You don't even make proper tea."</p>
        <p>
            把他们介绍给你妈妈认识，并告诉说他会做饭，恐怕她听不进其它事情了。你妈妈将会对他印象深刻，甚至开始讨论关于菜式做法之类的事情。几乎每位母亲都爱这一点，你妈妈可能还会对你吼道：“向他学习！你甚至连杯茶都泡不好。”。</p>
        <p>10. They never ask me to go to the kitchen.</p>
        <p><strong>他们绝不会要求我进厨房</strong></p>
        <p>I comfortably stay wherever I am and since they know I don't even know the ABC of cooking; they never make a
            comment or a request for that matter and always always make something delicious to feed me and other people
            around them.</p>
        <p>由于他们知道我对做饭没有一点概念，所以我可以很舒适的待在任意地方。他们从不会指指点点，也不会让你上前帮忙，依然总是会做出美味佳肴来满足我和身边的人。</p>
