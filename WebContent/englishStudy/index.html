		<p class="title">Living History at Jamestown Settlement</p>
		<p>A woman in Native American clothes is sitting in the sun,
			sewing a dress from skin. Inside a building, a colonist is making a
			wooden chair, using very simple tools. And all around, tourists are
			taking pictures with their digital (数码的) cameras. This is Jamestown
			Settlement today.</p>

		<p>Jamestown, Virginia, was one of the first places in the world
			where people from Europe, America, and Africa came together in 1608.
			Today, it is a living history museum, where children and adults come
			to experience history. In a living history museum, actors wear
			clothes from the past and demonstrate many of the activities of daily
			life back then. The actors also talk to the visitors and explain
			everything they do.</p>
		<p>At aLiving History museum, there are always many things to
			touch, hear ,and smell Visitors at Jamestown Settlement can walk
			through copies of the three small sailing ships that carried
			colonists to Virginia and even lie down in a colonist’s bed. The
			colonists stayed on the crowed, dangerous ships for more than four
			months. When they got to Virginia they built an area of houses with a
			high wall around it in today’s fort(堡垒)，you can see houses, a church,
			and even a garden with foods that the colonists ate. Women in long
			dresses work inside their homes, and visitors can help them with
			their sewing and cooking.</p>
		<p>There is also an Indian Village at Jamestown Settlement, and it
			looks very different from the fort. It shows how the Indians lived in
			long houses and grew corn and other crops in large fields. Actors
			there make pottery(陶器) and teach visitors how to play Indian games.
			You can even help them make an Indian boat from a tree.</p>
		<p>Today the living history museum of Jamestown is very popular,
			especially with children and families. People come here to have fun,
			but also to learn. Many school classes visit to experience old ways
			of getting things done. A living history museum is the best way to
			understand how people lived in the past.</p>
